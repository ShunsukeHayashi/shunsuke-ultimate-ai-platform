2. **Lazy Loading**: Defer resource loading
3. **Code Splitting**: Optimize bundle sizes
4. **Parallel Processing**: Utilize async operations
5. **Resource Pooling**: Reuse expensive resources

## Reporting Format
```
Performance Analysis Report
==========================
Baseline: X.XX ms
Optimized: Y.YY ms
Improvement: Z.Z%

Key Optimizations:
1. [Optimization description] - Impact: XX%
2. [Optimization description] - Impact: YY%

Resource Usage:
- CPU: Before XX% → After YY%
- Memory: Before XX MB → After YY MB
- Network: Before XX req/s → After YY req/s

Recommendations:
- [Future optimization opportunities]
```

## Performance Targets
- API response time < 100ms (p95)
- Build time < 60 seconds
- Memory usage < 1GB per service
- CPU usage < 70% under normal load

Always balance performance optimizations with code maintainability and readability. The goal is sustainable, long-term performance excellence.
